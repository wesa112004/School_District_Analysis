# School_District_Analysis
OverView: The purpose of this analysis was to compare different school districts and charters as far as performance for reading and math on standardized tests. Additionally, The final task was to determine if the outcome changed based on dropping the 9th grade reports from Thomas High school due to the possibility of academic dishonesty. 
### Results
** How is the district Summary affected?

The two pictures summarize the differences. The top one reflects the original district summary whereas the bottom the updated final summary after the drops. After the drop of the data with regards to the suspected schools cheating, the data isnt much different. If we apply the percent change formula to the data we have "Final - initial/ initial", for math that results to  .0069% change in math results and reading 00269% change. Ultimately the scores were lower after the drop but as you can see the amount was negligible.

######Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

We can see that the passing rates for THS have changed fairly drastically from around 90% to 65% when replacing the scores with NaNs, as well as their ranking in the schools has dropped in the district when compared to the overal rankings among 15 schools. The data for the 9th graders will show as NaNs so we wont be able to have reliable information on their performance. We also saw changes in overall reading and math averages change, which we would naturally see as changing or dropping data where the numbers are a part of the average will impact the overal results
